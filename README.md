**Jest**:
Jest is a testing framework developed specifically for JavaScript and React applications. It is widely used in the development community to write and run unit and integration tests efficiently

**react-test-renderer**:
`react-test-renderer` is a library provided by Facebook for React and React Native that allows component rendering testing without the need for an actual DOM. In the context of React Native, this library is used to create "snapshots" of how components are rendering at any given time.
